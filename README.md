# TRAIN


In this app, when adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
1.) Train Name
2.) Destination
3.) First Train Time -- in military time
4.) Frequency -- in minutes
The time when the next train arrives is calculated; this is relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
